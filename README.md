# Labels-Reborn-for-GB-Studio
A GB Studio script plugin that reimplements the deprecated "Define Label" and "Label Go To" events. 

# Installation
Download this repository as a zip file. After that, extract it and put the "Labels Reborn (Script Plugin)" folder into your GB Studio project's "plugins" folder.

# How To Use
For information on how this event is used, please refer to this guide:
[https://develop.gbstudio.dev/docs/scripting/#control-flow-events](https://develop.gbstudio.dev/docs/scripting/#control-flow-events)

# Credits
Chris Maltby for the code. All I did was change a couple lines to get this event "working"(*) again.

# * (Disclaimer)
Please note that this event is pretty broken due to a compiling issue (which is why it was removed from GB Studio in the first place).
If you're trying to accomplish a cheat code system (like the one linked here: https://gbstudiocentral.com/tips/creating-cheat-codes/), it'll work for that.
Anything else is unknown.
