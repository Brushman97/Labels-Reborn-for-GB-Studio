# Labels-Reborn-for-GB-Studio
A GB Studio script plugin that reimplements the deprecated "Define Label" and "Label Go To" events. 

# Installation
Download this repository as a zip file and extract it into your GB Studio project's "plugins" folder.

# Credits
Chris Maltby for the code. All I did was change a couple lines to get this event working again.
